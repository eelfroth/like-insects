# Like Insects
a game about creating huge piles of corpses, and collecting skulls for scoreâ€¦
this game was initially made for the [25th Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-25/?action=preview&uid=7288) competition. the majority of assets and code (including a small physics engine) were created within 48 hours.
the project is pretty finished but still in active development, as I polish some things up here and there.  

## Build
run it with [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/)  
tested on Linux with Processing 3.3.4 (REV 0261)

## Controls
Move: WASD  
Shoot: Mouse  
Press 'Space' while standing on a corpse to rip out its skull!
